```

```
Payment held in escrow â†’ Freelancer works on project â†’ Freelancer submits work
```

### 3. Review & Approval
```
Client reviews work â†’ Approves/Requests revisions â†’ Work approved â†’ Payment released to freelancer
```

### 4. Payment Release
```
Client approval â†’ Platform fee deducted â†’ Payment released to freelancer â†’ Transaction complete
```

- `GET /payment/cancel` - Payment cancellation page
- `POST /api/payment/notify` - PayHere webhook for payment notifications

### Work Management

## Environment Variables

```bash
# PayHere Configuration
PAYHERE_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
PAYHERE_MERCHANT_SECRET=your_merchant_secret
PAYHERE_MODE=sandbox # or 'live' for production
PAYHERE_CURRENCY=LKR

## Database Schema

### Core Payment Models
- **Payment**: Main payment record with escrow status
- **EscrowRelease**: Handles payment release workflow
- **WorkSubmission**: Tracks deliverable submissions
- **Milestone**: Manages milestone-based payments

### Key Relationships
- Applications can have multiple payments
- Payments can have multiple milestones
- Work submissions are linked to applications
- Escrow releases are tied to payments

## Usage Examples

### 1. Making a Payment (Client)
```tsx
// Navigate to payment page
<Link to={`/payment/${applicationId}`}>
  Make Payment
</Link>

// Payment automatically redirects to PayHere
// Client completes payment on PayHere gateway
// Funds are held in escrow
```

### 2. Submitting Work (Freelancer)
```tsx
// Submit work through the work interface
<Form method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="submit_work" />
  <input name="title" placeholder="Submission title" />
  <textarea name="description" placeholder="Work description" />
  <button type="submit">Submit Work</button>
</Form>
```

### 3. Approving Work (Client)
```tsx
// Client reviews and approves work
<Form method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="approve_work" />
  <input type="hidden" name="submissionId" value={submissionId} />
  <button type="submit">Approve Work</button>
</Form>
```
