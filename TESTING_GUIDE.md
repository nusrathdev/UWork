## 🎯 **Simplified Testing Guide - Current Payment System**

The wallet system requires database migration which seems to have some issues. Let me show you how to test the **existing payment system** that's already working:

## **🚀 Current Working Features:**

### **1. Project Payment Flow (Already Working):**
```
1. Client creates project
2. Freelancer applies 
3. Client approves application
4. Client makes payment via PayHere
5. Payment held in escrow
6. Freelancer delivers work
7. Client approves work
8. Payment released to freelancer
```

### **2. How to Test Current System:**

#### **Step 1: Login as Project Owner**
- Use: `john.doe@university.edu` or `jane.smith@university.edu`

#### **Step 2: Go to Dashboard**
- Visit: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
- Look for **green "Approved Applications"** section
- Click **💳 Make Payment** button

#### **Step 3: Or Use Direct Payment URLs**
Based on your existing applications:

**For "web" project (John pays Jane $2322):**
```
http://localhost:5173/payment/cmbyzh8xt0003nz504kjbvxnb
```

**For "Portfolio" project (Jane pays John $232):**  
```
http://localhost:5173/payment/cmbysrs5k0001nzr2gifgyqjn
```

#### **Step 4: Complete Payment Flow**
1. Fill payment form
2. Redirected to PayHere sandbox
3. Complete test payment
4. Redirected back to success page
5. Payment recorded in database

### **3. Test PayHere Integration:**

Use these **sandbox test cards** in PayHere:
- **Visa**: `4916217501611292`
- **MasterCard**: `5413110000000000`  
- **Expiry**: Any future date
- **CVV**: Any 3 digits

### **4. Check Payment Status:**

Visit: `http://localhost:5173/payments` to see payment history

### **5. Verify in Database:**

The system already has **1 payment** recorded:
- **From:** Test Client 
- **To:** Test Freelancer
- **Amount:** LKR 5000
- **Status:** PENDING

## **🔧 Next Steps:**

1. **Test current system first** ✅
2. **Fix wallet database migration** ⏳
3. **Add wallet functionality** ⏳

The **core payment system is working** - test it now while I fix the wallet migration! 🎉
